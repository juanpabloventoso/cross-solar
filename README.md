# cross-solar
CrossOver project test that got me into their marketplace. Bug fixes and unit test coverage increase.

I entered the CrossOver marketplace last week. This is my test project for evaluation.
Things I needed to do:

1)	Increase unit test coverage to reach 60% or more.
2)	Find bugs and fix them.
3) 	Frontend team wants to display panelâ€™s all historical data in a chart, in which each point represents electricity generated 
by this panel each day [sum, min, max, average] up to the end of previous day: implement backend part of this task,
API specifications already there in code as agreed with Frontend team, and it is ok to implement this task without any optimization.
